## mono

A (subset of) my ocaml monorepo. Only includes certain projects/libraries I want
to share publically.

Has vendored dependencies in `duniverse` using `opam-monorepo`. 

Currently a bit stale, both in terms of ocaml version and dependencies -- some
day want to port to oxcaml and get it building again.

Not neccesarily intended to be buildable without some work: haven't released all
the tooling and the tooling itself is a bit stale.
