      - [allowed], meaning the morphism can be on the left because it has right

        it does not have right adjoint.
      Similar for ['r]. *)

  (* Due to the implementation in [solver.ml], a mode doesn't have sufficient
     information to infer the object it lives in,  whether at compile-time or
     runtime. There is info at compile-time to distinguish between different
     carrier types, but one can imagine multiple objects with the same carrier
     type. Therefore, we can treat modes as object-blind.

     As a result, user of the solver needs to provide the object the modes live
     in, every time it invokes the solver on some modes.

     Roughly, ['a mode] is represented in the solver as constant of ['a], or [f
     v] where [f] is a morphism from ['b] to ['a] and [v] is some variable of
     ['b]. The ['a] needs additional ['a obj] to decide its position in the
     lattice structure (because again, multiple lattices can share the same
     carrier type). One might think the morphism [f] should know its own source
     and target objects. But since its target object is already given by the
     user for each invocation anyway, we decide to exploit this, and say that "a
     morphism is determined by some [('a, 'b, 'd) morph] together with some ['b
     obj]". That helps reduce the information each [morph] needs to store.

     As a result, in the interaction between the solver and the lattices,
     [morph] always comes with its target object. *)

  (** Compose two morphisms *)
  val compose :
    'c obj -> ('b, 'c, 'd) morph -> ('a, 'b, 'd) morph -> ('a, 'c, 'd) morph

  (* Usual notion of adjunction:
     Given two morphisms [f : A -> B] and [g : B -> A], we require [f a <= b]
      iff [a <= g b] for each [a \in A] and [b \in B].

     Our solver accepts a wider notion of adjunction: Given two morphisms [f : A
     -> B] and [g : B -> A], we require [f a <= b] iff [a <= g b] for each [a]
      in the downward closure of [g]'s image and [b \in B].

     We say [f] is a partial left adjoint of [g], because [f] is only
     constrained in part of its domain. As a result, [f] is not unique, since
     its valuation out of the constrained range can be arbitrarily chosen.

     Dually, we can define the concept of partial right adjoint. Since partial
     adjoints are not unique, they don't form a pair: i.e., a partial left
     joint of a partial right adjoint of [f] is not [f] in general.

     Concretely, the solver provides/requires the following guarantees
     (continuing the example above):

     For the user of the [Solvers_polarized].
     - [g] applied to a right mode [m] can be used as a right mode without
     any restriction.
     - [f] applied to to a left mode [m] can be used as a left mode, given that
     the [m] is fully within the downward closure of [g]. This is unfortunately
     not enforcable by the ocaml type system, and we have to rely on user's
     caution.

     For the supplier of the [Lattices_mono]:
     - The result of [left_adjoint g] is applied only on the downward closure of
     [g]'s image.
  *)

  (* Note that [left_adjoint] and [right_adjoint] returns a [morph] weaker than
     what we want, which is "\exists r. allowed * r". But ocaml doesn't like
     existentials, and this weaker version is good enough for us *)
