(** [unfold_and_evaluate] performs call-by-value evaluation of shapes. It should
    be applied after [reduce] (from [shape_reduce.ml]) has already been used.
    More specifically, when producing a type shape with [of_type_expr], the
    resulting shape is not a normal form. A normal form---at least for the
    emission into DWARF debug information---should no longer contain structures
    (from modules), lambdas (from functors and parametric types), application
    (from functor instantiation and type application), mutually recursive
    declarations and their projections ([Constr] and [Proj_decl]). (Due to
    missing information, it might still contain compilation units [Comp_unit]
    and projections [Proj] from them.)

    We reach the normal form of a type shape (e.g., during the emission of DWARF
    information) in two steps:

      1. We execute [shape_reduce], which will substitute compilation units with
         their shapes loaded from .cms files and then reduce away projections
         [Proj] and functor applications. It will also, partially, deal with
         instantiation of type variables. That is, [of_type_declaration] inserts
         lambdas for non-recursive types with type arguments. These are reduced
         away via [shape_reduce]. (For (mutually-)recursive types, the next step
         handles the instantiation.)
      2. After shape reduction, the type declaration can still contain recursive
         or mutually-recursive declarations, which have not been unfolded. Since
         we cannot directly emit these into DWARF, we then unfold recursive
         declarations applied to type shape arguments into recursive types with
         [unfold_and_evaluate]. For example,
           [type 'a list = [] | :: of 'a * 'a list]
         applied to [int] becomes the type shape
           [Mu (Variant [] | :: of int * #0)].

(* CR sspies: We need to revisit the treatment of layouts for type shapes.
   Currently, as the declaration above indicates, we use the layout from the
   binder of the variable and propagate it through. Once type shapes are merged
   into shapes, we should compute layouts on-demand from shapes directly. The
   reason is that, in the future, the layouts stored in the constructors of type
   declarations will become unreliable as a source of information. Instead, the
   strategy for layouts should be the following:

    1. For the closed types that we obtain at binders, compute the shape. In
       this step, type declarations with arguments should become lambdas, and
       type application should become application.
    2. When emitting the DWARF information, reduce the shape to resolve all
       abstraction/application pairs. Then emit the DWARF information by
       recursion on the resulting shape.

(* CR sspies: [estimate_layout_from_shape] below is only an approximation. It
   does, for example, not deal with type application and, as a result, can find
   type variables that would have been substituted. This layout computation
   needs to be revisited once type shapes have been integrated into shapes.

   If the function returns [Some], the layout is precise (regardless of the
   issues mentioned above). It returns [None] whenever estimation failed.
