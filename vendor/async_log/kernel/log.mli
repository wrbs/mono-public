(** A library for general logging.

    Although this module is fully Async-safe it exposes almost no Deferreds. This is
    partially a design choice to minimize the impact of logging in code, and partially the
    result of organic design (i.e., older versions of this interface did the same thing).

    A (limited) [Blocking] module is supplied to accommodate the portion of a program that
    runs outside of Async. *)

(** One common transformation on message events is tagging every remaining message with a

    [add_tags t ~tags] is shorthand for
    [Transform.prepend t (Message_event.add_tags ~tags)]. ([prepend] in this case means
    these tags are added before any other transformation is applied, which we believe is
    more often wanted, e.g. if a later transform flattens the message and tags into a
    single rendered string.)

    the resultant message. *)
