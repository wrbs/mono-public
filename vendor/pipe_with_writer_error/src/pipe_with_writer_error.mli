(** A [Pipe_with_writer_error.t] holds the read end of a pipe and a
    [(unit, 'error) Deferred.Result.t] that becomes determined when the write end succeeds
    or fails. On writer failure the pipe is closed but the remaining items can still be
    consumed. On writer success the pipe remains open until the writer is explicitly
    closed.

    Motivation: If you had a regular (reader, writer_error) pair and made the mistake of
    consuming the pipe until you reach EOF and not looking at the writer error, you can
    drop the writer error on the floor, or hang if the reader doesn't get an EOF when the
    writer encounters an error. A [Pipe_with_writer_error] forces you to handle the writer
    error when consuming the reader, and is indifferent to whether the underlying reader
    reaches EOF when the writer encounters an error (however, it still waits for the
    reader's [upstream_flushed]).

    Pitfalls: When using this module be sure that no writes are made after [writer_error]
    is filled with an error, or else you will encounter strange behavior. For example, you
    might [peek] and see the writer error but then [read] and read a subsequent write,
    which violates the expectation that peek returns the value that will next be read.
    Writes made in the same async job as the [writer_error] being filled will appear in
    the pipe, but writes made in subsequent Async jobs will only appear if those jobs run
    before the job that closes the pipe due to the error. For writes that are made in the
    same job as the [writer_error] being filled, there is no way to distinguish writes
    made before and after [writer_error] being filled. Writing after filling
    [writer_error] with an ok result is fine.

    See ../README.md for a comparison of the semantics of this library and the
    pipe_with_close_reason library. *)

(** [create_reader f] calls [f w] and collects the output [f] writes to [w]. The pipe
    returned by [create_reader] terminates successfully only when [f w] terminates
    successfully.

    If [f w] raises an exception, the exception is not caught here: it gets sent to the
    monitor that was in scope when [create_reader] was called. In this case the writer
    will not be closed and the [writer_error] will not be determined (analogous to the
    behavior of [Pipe.create_reader ~close_on_exception:false]). If you want exceptions to
    be instead be treated as writer errors you need to catch them yourself and return an
    appropriate [(unit, 'error) Result.t]. *)

    avoid an ivar allocation per call, so calling [values_available] in a loop without
    writing anything to a pipe will result in a memory leak. *)
