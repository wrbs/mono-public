  (** [scheduler ()] is a handle that allows spawning concurrent tasks in the Async
      scheduler from other threads. It uses the thread-safe external job queue in the
      async scheduler under the hood, so is less efficient than the non-portable
      [scheduler] if you don't need to spawn tasks from arbitrary threads.
