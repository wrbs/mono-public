(** Capsules are a mechanism for safely having [uncontended] access to mutable data from
    multiple threads. The interface in this module ensures that only one thread can have
    [uncontended] access to that data at a time.

    We consider every piece of mutable data in the program to live inside of some capsule.
    This might be an explicit capsule created by the user using this interface, or an
    implicit capsule created when a new thread is started. Whenever some thread is
    executing a function it has uncontended access to a single capsule and any new mutable
    data it creates is created within that capsule. We say that the function is "running
    within" the capsule.

    Capsules are only ever associated with one thread at a time, which ensures there are
    no data races in the program. The implicit capsules created when a new thread is
    started are only ever associated with that thread. Explicit capsules can change which
    threads have uncontended access to them using synchronization primitives.

    Each explicit capsule is associated with a type "brand" -- written ['k] throughout
    this interface -- which allows us to statically reason about access to the capsule
    within the type system. In the documentation of this interface we will often use ['k]
    to refer to the capsule associated with that brand.

    When you create a new capsule ['k] via [create], the library returns a unique
    ['k Key.t] that grants you exclusive ownership of that capsule. You can temporarily
    hand out a [Password.t] (or [Password.Shared.t]) to functions or threads that need to
    access the capsule. This ensures that mutable data is only ever accessed in accordance
    with the capsule's concurrency rules.

    Using a ['k Key.t] more than once turns it into an [aliased] key. Aliased global keys
    indicate that the corresponding capsule has been permanently shared across threads
    with read-only access.

    This module only provides interfaces that statically rule out data races. The [Await]
    library augments capsules with various synchronization primitives that prevent races
    at runtime.

    {1 Exceptions}

    Currently, it is possible to break the soundness guarantees of the capsule API by
    defining an exception which contains mutable state or nonportable functions, and
    "smuggling" values out of a capsule by raising that exception out of one of the
    callbacks in this module. In the medium-term, we plan to distinguish portable
    exception constructors, whose contents cross portability and contention, from
    nonportable exception constructors. In the meantime we are consciously leaving this
    soundness gap for the sake of improved ergonomics over encapsulating exceptions. *)
