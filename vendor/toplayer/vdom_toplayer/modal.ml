  (* Unfortunately, locking scroll by setting [overflow: hidden] results in a small layout
     shift, because of the scrollbar disappearing / reappearing.

     Setting[:root]'s [scrollbar-gutter] to [stable] or [stable both-edges] fixes this if
     content is overflowing at time of modal open, but if it is not, that will create a
     layout shift for adding the gutter. We don't want to set [scrollbar-gutter] for all
     apps, because that unconditionally wastes ~16px on each side.

     It might be possible to reimplement this locking via JS code that runs on modal
     activate / deactivate, but the semantics would be very difficult to get right,
     because:

     - Content might change while the page is opened
     - We can't get the scrollbar width while we have set [overflow: hidden]

     For now, the best path forward seems to be for apps that care about the layout shift
     to set up [scrollbar-gutter] themselves
