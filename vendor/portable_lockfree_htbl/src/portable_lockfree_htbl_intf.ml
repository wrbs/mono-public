  (** Lock-free hash table designed for use in concurrent and parallel algorithms.

      The signatures of operations provided by this hash table are intentionally different
      from what you would see in a typical sequential hash table. In a concurrent setting
      it is often expected that multiple threads may concurrently access the table with
      the same key and it is crucial for the correctness of such concurrent algorithms to
      take this into account. This is one of the reasons why operations return a value
      indicating the previous or current state of the accessed binding and, in many cases,
      do not modify the table in case the state was different from what the operation
      expected. In most cases the caller needs to examine the result and act accordingly.
      More technically, the operation signatures and semantics are designed to allow
      building
      {{:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62546.62593} consensus protocols over arbitrary
        numbers of processes}.

      Single key reads with this hash table are actually wait-free rather than just
      lock-free. Internal resizing automatically uses all the threads that are trying to
      write to the hash table. *)

  (** [update t key ~pure_f] calls [pure_f] with the result of [find t key] and then tries

      binding of [key] depending on the return value of [pure_f] and the result of [find].
      The update is retried until it succeeds and [pure_f] may be called multiple times.
      Returns the last result of [find t key] before a successful update. *)
