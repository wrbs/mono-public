(** Many operations have the property that they might return immediately, or they might
    block on some system operation. A ['a Maybe_pushback.t] allows us to chain together
    operations such that we do not jump into the Async scheduler until we hit an operation
    that requires us to. It's the same as [Eager_deferred.t], but with a type that is
    unique from [Deferred.t] so that you have to be more explicit about where you are
    willing to yield to the scheduler. *)
