(** [typeset] will "typeset" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting the text. It will
    break up your text attempting to do "word wrapping" so that each line fits in
    max_width so that the output lines fit within max_width.

    It is important to note that only the "visual" part of the line will be <= max_width.
    If a line has trailing whitespace, that whitespace can exceed [max_width] as long as
    the "visual" width is <= max_width.

    [max_width] is treated as [Int.max 5 max_width] so that the weird unicode characters
    don't get weirder. e.g. some unicode characters can take up 2 chars though this
    behavior is not stable across terminal emulators, as some terminal emulators will make
    some emojis look as wide as 4 chars. *)

(** [typeset_line] is line [typeset], but will only do a single line. *)
