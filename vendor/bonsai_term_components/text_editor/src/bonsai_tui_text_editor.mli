(** [bonsai_tui_text_editor] is a tiny library that provides a tiny text editor.

    - UTF-8 support
    - "Standard" keybindings
    - VIM keybindings
    - Line wrapping (via word breaking)

    It's main purpose is to provide a rich text edciting experience in apps with
    complicated text editing requirements. If the current library does not fulfill your
    requirements, please reach out!

    You can see a demo of this component in [./examples/text_editor/bin/main.exe]. *)

(** [text] is the inputted string.

    [send_actions] lets you send commands to the text editor. NOTE: For opinionated
    "normal", and "vim" keybindings, you can pass [send_actions] to either
    [Vim.vim_keybindings_handler] or [default_keybindings_handler].

    [view] is the view for the text editor.

    [cursor] let's you know the location of the cursor according to the text editor.

    NOTE: if you would like to get the cursor position "visualy" relative to other
    elements in the view, you can use [get_cursor_relative_position].

    [set_text] let's you update the string value of the textbox. Undo history is lost, but
    cursor position will be attempted to be preserved.

    [get_cursor_position view] will give you the location of the text editor's cursor
    relative top-left of the view that you give it. The text editor can be embedded
    anywhere inside of [view] and [get_cursor_position] will give you a location relative
    to the top-left corner of the view. You can use this if you would like to set the
    cursor positionining. *)

(** [Bonsai_tui_text_editor.component] is a tiny text editor.

    [match_word] is used to recognize 'words' (some commands operate on words). It must
    returns the end of the matched word if any.

    [undo_size] is the size of the undo buffer. It is the number of state zed will
    remember. It defaults to [1000].

    [text_attrs] is the default attributes attaced to text. We do not currently support
    syntax highlighting.

    [width] The editor will attempt to have a width of [width] and will start wrapping
    lines when a line reaches [width].

    [max_height]. The text editor's height will be [min (height view) max_height]. If
    there are more lines visually in the editor than max_height, the element will start
    scrolling. *)
