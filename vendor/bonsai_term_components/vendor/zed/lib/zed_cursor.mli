(** Cursors *)

(** A cursor is a pointer in an edition buffer. When some text is inserted or removed, all
    cursors after the modification are automatically moved accordingly. *)

open React

(** Type of a cursor. *)
type t

(** Exception raised when trying to move a cursor outside the bounds of the text it points
    to. *)
exception Out_of_bounds

(** [create length changes get_lines position wanted_column] creates a new cursor pointing
    to position [position].

    [length] is the current length of the text the cursor points to. It raises
    {!Out_of_bounds} if [position] is greater than [length].

    [changes] is an event which occurs with values of the form [(start, added, removed)]
    when the text changes, with the same semantic as {!Zed_edit.changes}.

    [get_lines] is used to retreive the current set of line positions of the text. It is
    used to compute the line and column of the cursor.

    [wanted_column] is the column on which the cursor want to be, if there is enough room
    on the line. *)
val create : int -> (int * int * int) event -> (unit -> Zed_lines.t) -> int -> int -> t

(** [copy cursor] creates a copy of the given cursor. The new cursor initially points to
    the same location as [cursor]. *)
val copy : t -> t

(** [position cursor] returns the signal holding the current position of the given cursor. *)
val position : t -> int signal

(** [get_position cursor] returns the current position of [cursor]. *)
val get_position : t -> int

(** [line cursor] returns the signal holding the current line on which the cursor is. *)
val line : t -> int signal

(** [get_line cursor] returns the current line of the cursor. *)
val get_line : t -> int

(** [column cursor] returns the signal holding the current column of the cursor. *)
val column : t -> int signal

(** [get_column cursor] returns the current column of the cursor. *)
val get_column : t -> int

(** [coordinates cursor] returns the signal holding the current line & column of the
    cursor. *)
val coordinates : t -> (int * int) signal

(** [get_coordinates cursor] returns the current line & column of the cursor. *)
val get_coordinates : t -> int * int

(** [wanted_column cursor] returns the signal holding the column on which the cursor wants
    to be. *)
val wanted_column : t -> int signal

(** [get_wanted_column cursor] returns the column on which the cursor wants to be. *)
val get_wanted_column : t -> int

(** [set_wanted_column cursor] sets the column on which the cursor want to be. *)
val set_wanted_column : t -> int -> unit

(** [goto cursor position] moves the given cursor to the given position. It raises
    {!Out_of_bounds} if [position] is outside the bounds of the text. If
    [set_wanted_column] is [true] (the default), then the wanted column will be set to the
    column of the cursor at given position. *)
val goto : t -> ?set_wanted_column:bool -> int -> unit

(** [move cursor delta] moves the given cursor by the given number of characters. It
    raises {!Out_of_bounds} if the result is outside the bounds of the text. *)
val move : t -> ?set_wanted_column:bool -> int -> unit
