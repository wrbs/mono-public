(** Type of unicode ropes. *)
type t [@@deriving sexp]

(** Alias. *)
type rope = t

(** Exception raised when trying to access a character which is outside the bounds of a
    rope. *)
exception Out_of_bounds

(** {6 Construction} *)

(** The empty rope. *)
val empty : t

(** [make length char] creates a rope of length [length] containing only [char]. *)
val make : int -> Zed_char.t -> t

(** [init n f] returns the contenation of [singleton (f 0)], [singleton (f 1)], ...,
    [singleton (f (n - 1))]. *)

    [singleton (f 1)], [singleton (f 0)]. *)

(** {6 To/from strings} *)

(** [of_string str] creates a rope from a string. The string must be UTF-8 encoded and is
    validated. Note that [str] must not be modified after this operation, if you intend to
    do so you must copy it before passing it to [of_string]. *)

(** {6 Zippers} *)

module Zip : sig
  (** Type of zippers. A zipper allow to naviguate in a rope in a convenient and efficient
      manner. Note that a zipper points to a position between two characters, not to a
      character, so in a rope of length [len] there is [len + 1] positions. *)

  (** Returns the position of the zipper in the rope. *)
  val offset : t -> int

  (** [next zipper] returns the code point at the right of the zipper and a zipper to the
      next position. It raises [Out_of_bounds] if the zipper points to the end of the
      rope. *)
  val next : t -> Zed_char.t * t

  (** [prev zipper] returns the code point at the left of the zipper and a zipper to the
      previous position. It raises [Out_of_bounds] if the zipper points to the beginning
      of the rope. *)
  val prev : t -> Zed_char.t * t

  (** [move n zip] moves the zipper by [n] characters. If [n] is negative it is moved to
      the left and if it is positive it is moved to the right. It raises [Out_of_bounds]
      if the result is outside the bounds of the rope. *)
  val move : int -> t -> t

  (** [at_bos zipper] returns [true] iff [zipper] points to the beginning of the rope. *)

  val at_eos : t -> bool

  (** [find_f f zip] search forward for a character to satisfy [f]. It returns a zipper
      pointing to the left of the first character to satisfy [f], or a zipper pointing to
      the end of the rope if no such character exists. *)
  val find_f : (Zed_char.t -> bool) -> t -> t

  (** [find_b f zip] search backward for a character to satisfy [f]. It returns a zipper
      pointing to the right of the first character to satisfy [f], or a zipper pointing to
      the beginning of the rope if no such character exists. *)

  (** [sub zipper len] returns the sub-rope of length [len] pointed by [zipper]. *)
  val sub : t -> int -> rope

  (** [slice zipper1 zipper2] returns the rope between [zipper1] and [zipper2]. If
      [zipper1 > zipper2] then this is the same as [slice zipper2 zipper1].

      The result is unspecified if the two zippers do not points to the same rope. *)
  val slice : t -> t -> rope

(** {6 Buffers} *)

module Buffer : sig
