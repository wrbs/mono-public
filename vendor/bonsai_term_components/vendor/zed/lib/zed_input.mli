(** Helpers for writing key bindings *)

(** Signature for binders. *)
module type S = sig
  (** Type of events. *)
  type event

  (** Type of set of bindings mapping input sequence to values of type ['a]. *)
  type +'a t

  (** The empty set of bindings. *)
  val empty : 'a t

  (** [add events x bindings] binds [events] to [x]. It raises [Invalid_argument] if
      [events] is empty. *)
  val add : event list -> 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t

  (** [remove events bindings] unbinds [events]. It raises [Invalid_argument] if [events]
      is empty. *)
  val remove : event list -> 'a t -> 'a t

  (** [fold f set acc] executes [f] on all sequence of [set], accumulating a value. *)
  val fold : (event list -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b

  (** [bindings set] returns all bindings of [set]. *)
  val bindings : 'a t -> (event list * 'a) list

  (** Type of a resolver. A resolver is used to resolve an input sequence, i.e. to find
      the value associated to one. It returns a value of type ['a] when a matching
      sequence is found. *)
  type 'a resolver

  (** A pack is a pair of a set of bindings and a mapping function. *)
  type 'a pack = Pack : 'b t * ('b -> 'a) -> 'a pack

  (** [resolver packs] creates a resolver from a list of pack. *)
  val resolver : 'a pack list -> 'a resolver

  (** Result of a resolving operation. *)
  type 'a result =
    | Accepted of 'a (** The sequence is terminated and associated to the given value. *)
    | Continue of 'a resolver (** The sequence is not terminated. *)
    | Rejected (** None of the sequences is prefixed by the one. *)

  (** [resolve event resolver] tries to resolve [event] using [resolver]. *)
  val resolve : event -> 'a resolver -> 'a result
end

(** [Make (Event)] makes a a new binder. *)
module Make (Event : Map.OrderedType) : S with type event = Event.t
