    provided. If you are writing performance-critical code you should use the versions
    with the hard-coded arguments (e.g. [iround_down_exn]). The [_exn] ones are the
    fastest.

    - [of_int (iround_*_exn i) = i] for any float32 [i] that is an integer with
      [min_int <= i <= max_int].

    - [round_* i = i] for any float32 [i] that is an integer.

    [to_string_hum ~decimals:3 ~strip_zero:true 1234.1999s = "1_234.2" ]. No delimiters
    are inserted to the right of the decimal. *)
val to_string_hum

  -> ?strip_zero:bool (** defaults to [false] *)
  -> ?explicit_plus:bool
       (** Forces a + in front of non-negative values. Defaults to [false] *)
  -> t
  -> string

(** Produce a lossy compact string representation of the float32. The float32 is scaled by
    an appropriate power of 1000 and rendered with one digit after the decimal point,
    except that the decimal point is written as '.', 'k', 'm', 'g', 't', or 'p' to
    indicate the scale factor. (However, if the digit after the "decimal" point is 0, it
    is suppressed.)

    The smallest scale factor that allows the number to be rendered with at most 3 digits
    to the left of the decimal is used. If the number is too large for this format (i.e.,
    the absolute value is at least 999.95e15), scientific notation is used instead. E.g.:

    - [to_padded_compact_string     (-0.01s) =  "-0  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string       1.89s  =   "1.9"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 999_949.99s  = "999k9"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 999_950.s    =   "1m "]

    In the case where the digit after the "decimal", or the "decimal" itself is omitted,
    the numbers are padded on the right with spaces to ensure the last two columns of the
    string always correspond to the decimal and the digit afterward (except in the case of
    scientific notation, where the exponent is the right-most element in the string and
    could take up to four characters).

    - [to_padded_compact_string    1.s =    "1  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string  1.e6s =    "1m "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 1.e16s = "1.e+16"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string max_finite_value = "1.8e+308"]

    Numbers in the range -.05 < x < .05 are rendered as "0 " or "-0 ".

    Other cases:

    - [to_padded_compact_string nan          =  "nan  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string infinity     =  "inf  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string neg_infinity = "-inf  "]

    Exact ties are resolved to even in the decimal:

    - [to_padded_compact_string      3.25s =  "3.2"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string      3.75s =  "3.8"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 33_250.s   = "33k2"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 33_350.s   = "33k4"]

    [to_padded_compact_string] is defined in terms of [to_padded_compact_string_custom]
    below as

(** {2 Exponents and trigonometry} *)

(** [int_pow x n] computes [x ** float32 n] via repeated squaring. It is generally much
    faster than [**].

    Note that [int_pow x 0] always returns [1.s], even if [x = nan]. This coincides with
    [x ** 0.s] and is intentional.

    For [n >= 0] the result is identical to an n-fold product of [x] with itself under
    [*], with a certain placement of parentheses. For [n < 0] the result is identical to
    [int_pow (1.s / x) (-n)].

    The error will be on the order of [|n|] ulps, essentially the same as if you perturbed
    [x] by up to a ulp and then exponentiated exactly.

    Benchmarks show a factor of 5-10 speedup (relative to [**]) for exponents up to about
    1000 (approximately 10ns vs. 70ns). For larger exponents the advantage is smaller but
    persists into the trillions. For a recent or more detailed comparison, run the
    benchmarks.
