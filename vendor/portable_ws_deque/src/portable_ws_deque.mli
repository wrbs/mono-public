(** Lock-free single-producer, multi-consumer dynamic-size double-ended queue (deque).

    The main strength of deque in a typical work-stealing setup with per-core structure is
    efficient work distribution. Owner uses [push] and [pop] method to operate at one end
    of the deque, while other (free) cores can efficiently steal work on the other side.

    This approach is great for throughput. Stealers and owner working on different sides
    reduces contention in work distribution. Further, local LIFO order runs related tasks
    one after one improves locality.

    On the other hand, the local LIFO order does not offer any fairness guarantees. Thus,
    it is not the best choice when tail latency matters. *)
