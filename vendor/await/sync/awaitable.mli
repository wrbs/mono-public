(** [await w t ~until_phys_unequal_to:v] suspends the caller until the awaitable [t] is
    explicitly signaled and/or has a value physically unequal to [v].

    The return value is {!Signaled} in case the await was woken up due to a {!signal} or
    {!broadcast} on the awaitable. Otherwise the return value is {!Terminated}.

    This operation is subject to the ABA problem. An await for a value other than [A] may
    not return after the awaitable is signaled while having the value [B], because at a
    later point the awaitable has again the value [A]. Furthermore, by the time an await
    for value other than [A] returns, the awaitable might already again have the value
    [A].

    Atomic operations that change the value of an awaitable do not implicitly wake up
    awaiters.

    [await] establishes a {b happens-before} relationship with any reads and writes on the
    current thread that precede it, and the comparison of the current value of the
    awaitable [t] with the given value [v]. *)

    [await w t ~until_phys_unequal_to:v], but the caller will also be resumed in case the
    cancellation token [c] becomes canceled.

    The return value is {!Signaled} in case the await was woken up due to a {!signal} or
    {!broadcast} on the awaitable. Otherwise the return value is either {!Terminated} in
    case [w] is terminated, and {!Canceled} in case [c] is canceled. *)

(** An expert interface that allows an await to be setup separately from suspending the
    thread of control. This makes it possible to e.g. implement condition variables, which
    requires setting up the await before unlocking the associated mutex, and also makes it
    possible to await for one of many things. *)

  (** [create_and_add t s ~until_phys_unequal_to:v] creates a single-use awaiter with the

      and returns the awaiter. *)

  (** [cancel_and_remove a] signals the trigger of the awaiter [a] and cancels the awaiter
      such that it will not be selected by {!signal} or {!broadcast}, and removes the
      awaiter [a] from the awaitable into which [a] was originally added.

      This can be called even after something has already signaled the trigger of the
      awaiter [a]. In such cases [cancel_and_remove] will signal another awaiter on the
      awaitable, if one is available, so that the other awaiter can react to the signal
      instead.

      If the associated trigger is used with only one awaiter and the await on the trigger
      was neither terminated nor canceled, there is no need to explicitly
      [cancel_and_remove], because the awaiter [a] has already been used and removed from
      the awaitable . *)
