(** [t] is the type of implementations of awaiting. Operations that need to await
    something take a [t] that provides an implementation of awaiting for them to use.

    Any awaiting operation can be terminated by the awaiting implementation, which results
    in a [Terminated] exception being raised. *)

(** [with_ terminator ~yield ~await c ~f] calls [f] with an awaiter that has [terminator]
    as its terminator, [yield c] as its implementation of [yield], and [await c] as its
    implementation of [await]. *)

(** [terminator t] is the terminator associated with [t]. Awaiting operations should
    attempt to cancel themselves if they have been terminated, raising [Terminated] if
    they succeed in doing so. *)
val terminator : t @ local -> Terminator.t @ local

(** [await t ~on_terminate ~await_on] will use [t] to attach [on_terminate] to be
    signalled on termination and to wait until [await_on] has been signaled.

    Note that the [on_terminate] trigger may not be used by [await]. The [await_on]
    trigger will be used before [await] returns. *)

(** [await_with_terminate_or_cancel t c trigger ~terminate_or_cancel r] will attach a

(** [with_terminator t new_terminator] is an awaiter [u] like [t] where [terminator u] is
    [new_terminator].

    The main use case of [with_terminator] is to protect a blocking operation from being
    terminated by replacing the terminator with {!Terminator.never}:
    {[
      blocking_operation (with_terminator t Terminator.never)

    [t].

    @raise [Terminated] if the terminator associated with [t] has been terminated. *)

module For_testing : sig
  (** [with_never ~f] calls [f] with an implementation of awaiting that should never be
      used. If [await] is called with the implementation, it will raise.

      This is useful in tests, for testing operations which otherwise might conditionally
      block in a single-threaded manner that never needs to block.

      Bear in mind that proper implementations of [await] do not usually raise and are not
      documented to potentially raise. This means that abstractions built on await may
      e.g. leave the program in an invalid state when using [with_never]. *)
