(** [Bonsai_term] is a library that lets you build OCaml TUIs (terminal UIs) using Bonsai.
    This is kind of like [bonsai_web], but for terminals.

    To learn how to use this library, you can read this MLI and/or look at some examples
    under the ./examples directory.

    To learn how to use bonsai, you can read our docs at `lib/bonsai/docs`, do the bonsai
    teach in. *)

include module type of Geom

(** [View.t] and [Attr.t] are ~analogous to [bonsai_web]'s [Node.t] and [Attr.t].

    You can use these to construct the "view" of your TUI. *)

module View = View
module Attr = Attr

(** When your users type a key, click, scroll, ... [bonsai_term] will give you an
    [Event.t].

    You can "react" to events by implementing a "handler" function of type
    [Event.t -> unit Effect.t]. *)
module Event = Event

(** [View.With_handler.t] is a helper type alias that contains your "view" and a
    "handler".

    {[
      type View.With_handler.t = view:View.t * handler:(Event.t -> unit Effect.t)
    ]}

    {v
      - A [bonsai_web]  "app" is a function of type [local Bonsai.graph -> Vdom.Node.t Bonsai.t].
      - A [bonsai_term] "app" is a function of type [dimensions:Dimensions.t Bonsai.t -> local Bonsai.graph -> View.With_handler.t Bonsai.t].
    v}

    In [bonsai_web], the browser is responsible for feeding the right mouse/keyboard/...
    events to the "focused" element and calls the right "on_click"/"on_change"/...
    listener.

    In [bonsai_term], you, the app author are responsible for implementing the global
    "handler" function. Sadly, there isn't a "focused" textbox/"tab focus cycling" in
    [bonsai_term]. You, the app author are responsible for keeping track of "focus". *)

(** [Effect.t] is kind of like [bonsai_web]'s [Effect.t], with some terminal specific
    effects. *)
module Effect = Effect

(** [start] is will run your app. The [unit Deferred.t] is determined when the user hits
    [Ctrl-C]. If you would like an exit that is different from [Ctrl+C], please refer to
    [start_with_exit]

    [~target_frames_per_second] is the "framerate" that bonsai_term should attempt to
    follow. Defaults to 60, which makes each frame wait attempt to wait for ~16ms. If a
    frame took (> 0ms , but less than 16ms to render), it will wait for
    [ 16ms - time_taken ]. If a frame took [ >= 16ms ] to render, bonsai_term won't wait
    for the next frame.

    [~dispose] arranges for automatic {{!release} cleanup} of the terminal before the
    process terminates. The downside is that a reference to this terminal is retained
    until the program exits. Defaults to [false].

    [~nosig] additionally turns off signal delivery and flow control ({e isig} and
    {e ixon}) on input. Inhibits automatic handling of {e CTRL-\{C,Z,\,S,Q\}}. Defaults to
    [true].

    [~mouse] activates mouse reporting. Defaults to [true].

    [~bpaste] activates bracketed paste reporting. Defaults to [true].

    [~time_source] is which async time source to use for time-keeping. Defaults to
    [wall_clock] though you can pass a custom time source for controlling time in tests.

    [~reader] and [~writer] by default default to the stdin reader and the stdout writer
    respectively. Bonsai_term will receive and parse input events from [reader] and write
    output events to [writer]. Use this if you would like to "redirect" the input/output
    that bonsai term uses.

    [for_mocking] allows you to "mock" the terminal environment of [bonsai_term]. Please
    refer to [Notty_async.For_mocking.t] for the specifics of what can be mocked. *)

(** [start_with_exit] is like [start] but allows you to customize _when_ to exit and also
    allows you to "return" something upon exiting.

    Unlike [start], this mode will _not_ exit by default when you press [Ctrl+C]. If you
    would like to exit when [Ctrl+C] is pressed you must intentionally schedule [exit] to
    occur when [Ctrl+C] is pressed in your app's handler. *)

    top-left terminal corner is [{ row = 0; column = 0}]

    [row] increases downward and [column] increases to the right. *)
