(** [Frame_outcome.t] is the result of "what should happen next" after an [Event.t] is
    processed.

    Right now, the outcome of an event can be either the app shutting down (e.g. upon an
    [End] event being received/the user pressing [Ctrl+C] OR the outcome can be to
    [continue] which is either processing the next pending event or waiting for the next
    event).

    [Stdin_closed] is received when the input stdin that is used for interactivity is
    closed. This effectively kills interactivity of the app. In this case, we will return
    an error, but [bonsai_term] internals still need to do some cleanup so we edit it
    here. *)
