```ocaml
# open Base
```

This is [Int63.max_int] plus one.
```ocaml
# let (n : Int63.t) = 4611686018427387904J
Line 1, characters 21-41:
Error: Integer literal exceeds the range of representable integers of type [Base.Int63.t]
```

This is [Int64.max_int] plus one.
```ocaml
# let (n : Int63.t) = 9223372036854775808J
Line 1, characters 21-41:
Error: Integer literal exceeds the range of representable integers of type [Base.Int63.t]
```

This is too big to overflow to a negative number in [Int63.t], but
would work as an int64 literal.
```ocaml
# let (n : Int63.t) = 0x8000000000000000J
Line 1, characters 21-40:
Error: Integer literal exceeds the range of representable integers of type [Base.Int63.t]
# let (n : int64)   = 0x8000000000000000L
val n : int64 = -9223372036854775808
```

This is too big to overflow even as an int64 literal.
```ocaml
# let (n : Int63.t) = 0x10000000000000000J
Line 1, characters 21-41:
Error: Integer literal exceeds the range of representable integers of type [Base.Int63.t]
```

This literal is invalid.
```ocaml
# let (n : Int63.t) = 123abc456J
Line 1, characters 21-31:
Error: Invalid literal 123abc456J
```

Not supported in patterns.
```ocaml
# match 0J with | 0J -> () | _ -> ()
Line 1, characters 17-19:
Error: Unknown modifier J for literal 0J
```
