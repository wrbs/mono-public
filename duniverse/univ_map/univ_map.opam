synopsis: "Universal/heterogeneous maps, useful for storing values of arbitrary type in a single map."
description: "
In order to recover a value, it must be looked up with exactly the [Key.t] it was
stored in. In other words, given different [Key.t]s from the same [string], one will
not be able to recover the key stored in the other one.

This is similar to [Univ] in spirit.
