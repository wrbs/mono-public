   maps back to 0.

   This should work both on little-endian and high-endian CPUs.  Wikipedia says: "on
   modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely
   assume that the endianness is the same for floating point numbers as for integers"
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Floating-point_and_endianness).

(* [upper_bound_for_int] and [lower_bound_for_int] are for calculating the max/min float
   that fits in a given-size integer when rounded towards 0 (using [int_of_float]).

   max_int/min_int depend on [num_bits], e.g. +/- 2^30, +/- 2^62 if 31-bit, 63-bit
   (respectively) while float is IEEE standard for double (52 significant bits).

   In all cases, we want to guarantee that
   [lower_bound_for_int <= x <= upper_bound_for_int]
   iff [int_of_float x] fits in an int with [num_bits] bits.

   [2 ** (num_bits - 1)] is the first float greater that max_int, we use the preceding
   float as upper bound.

   [- (2 ** (num_bits - 1))] is equal to min_int.
   For lower bound we look for the smallest float [f] satisfying [f > min_int - 1] so that
   [f] rounds toward zero to [min_int]

   So in particular we will have:
   [lower_bound_for_int x <= - (2 ** (1-x))]
   [upper_bound_for_int x  <    2 ** (1-x) ]
