Libraries
=========

Dune, as a package, is primarily an executable, but its source tree embeds a
few public libraries. These are developed in :file:`otherlibs/`.

Some of these have a special link to Dune, such as ``dune-build-info`` or
``dune-site``. Others are just helper libraries that we develop as part of
Dune, but they have a strong relation to the Dune internals, like ``dyn`` or
``xdg``.
