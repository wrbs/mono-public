@@ portable

(** This module contains miscellaneous machinery for interacting with the portability and
    contention modes while support is being finished in the compiler. Functions in this
    module that have "magic" in their name are unsafe, and must be used very carefully.
    Other functions are safe interfaces implemented in terms of unsafe logic; feel free to
    use these without concern.

    Prefer using functions from this module over [Stdlib.Obj.magic*] when the reason for
    the magic is simply a temporary lack of support for a feature in the compiler. This
    will allow us to later search for uses of the corresponding function when a feature is
    updated and remove the unnecessary magic. *)

(** A safe api for making values cross portability and contention when doing so requires
    not-yet-supported with-kinds. Example idiomatic usage:

    {[
      let use_portably (_ @ portable) = ()

      let f (x : (string * bool) list @@ nonportable) =
        Cross.Portable.(cross (list (tuple2 infer infer))) x |> use_portably
      ;;
    ]} *)
