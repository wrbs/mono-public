(* Some ppxs --- including [quickcheck] --- provide a [~portable] flag in structure
   position that can be used to enforce that the implementation is portable. However, not
   all ppxs provide this. Despite the fact that [quickcheck] _does_ provide [~portable]
   and so wouldn't actually need [[%%rederive.portable]], we still use it for these tests,
   because it is an example of a ppx that is especially unlikely to produce portable
   definitions by default (while other ppxs that do not currently offer [~portable] might
   switch to providing portable definitions by default and, on doing so, break these
   tests).
