(** Popover's are similar to tooltips, but they can contain arbitrary state of their own,
    you can also control when they open rather than opening by default when hovering. The
    "base" of the component is the element that is always there. The "popover" itself is the
    element that pops out when then [open_] effect is scheduled. You have full control over the
    creation of the "base" element by the function that is given to the popover. The popover element
    that you create through the popover function is later wrapped around another div to
    handle the "hovering" styles for you. You can attach extra attrs to this element through
    [popover_extra_attr]. The popover element itself also has some default styling of its own
    which you can override using [popover_style_attr].

    [component] will "wrap" your "base" around a [Vdom.Node.span]. If you want to attach
    attributes to the wrapping span, you can use [?base_extra_attr].

    [close_when_clicked_outside], when set to true, will close the popover if
    a click occurs outside of the popover. *)
