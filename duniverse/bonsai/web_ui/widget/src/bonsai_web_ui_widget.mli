  (** The [init] function is used to construct the widget's initial state and the
      dom element that it is tied to.  It is passed the input for the widget, alongside
      a [get_input] function that will always return the most recent input passed to the
      widget.  You can close over [get_input] or store it in your [state]. *)
  val init : get_input:(unit -> input) -> input -> state * element Js.t

  (** Update is called whenever the input to the widget changes.  The most recent input
      value that was passed to the widget is available via [prev_input]. *)
  val update : prev_input:input -> input -> state -> element Js.t -> element Js.t

      cleanup here. *)

      of the widget. *)

(** A component that makes it easy to build low-level components that make direct
    modifications to the DOM.  Because this component returns a [Vdom.Node.t] and that
    vdom node can be placed in multiple locations in the vdom, this component actually
    tracks a _set of instances_ of this widget.  This is why the [read] function produces
    a list of read values. *)

module Low_level : sig
  (** A mutable-state tracker is meant to be used in concert with [Vdom.Node.widget] or
      [Vdom.Attr.create_hook].  Because a widget and hook can exist in multiple places in
      the dom at the same time, this state-tracker actually tracks a collection of states,
      which is why [read] returns a list, and the callback you pass to [modify] can get
      called multiple times per invocation.

      [unsafe_init] should be called inside the widget or hooks's [init] function and is
      passed some subset of the widget's state.  Then, you must store the returned Id.t in
      the widget's state.  If [unsafe_init] is called, then you _must_ call [unsafe_destroy]
      with the returned ID or you risk leaking memory, and making the output of calls to
      [read] return stale data.

      [unsafe_destroy] should be called inside the widget or hook's [destroy] function,
      and must be passed the same [id] that was returned from the corresponding [create].

      [modify] can be invoked to run some mutating function on the widget's state.  It is legal to
      use this function anywhere that an Effect can be scheduled.

      [read] provides access to the states of each instance managed by this mutable-state-tracker.
      You can use this function anywhere that an Effect can be scheduled. *)
