    [profile]s of the benchmarks. See [profile] below for more details. *)

  (** A ['action Interaction.t] represents an interaction that occurs with a
      [Component] whose action type is ['action]. *)

      with the supplied action. *)
  val inject : 'action -> 'action t

  (** [advance_clock_by] advances the current clock by the supplied amount. Note that the
      clock is not reset between benchmark runs. *)

  (** [stabilize] forces a stabilization of the incremental graph for the component being
      benchmarked. *)

      the beginning of the benchmark. *)

  (** [profile] indicates that the [profile] function below should print a snapshot of the
      time spent in each part of your computation since the previous snapshot.

      Note: profiling interactions are filtered out in [benchmark] runs, so you needn't
      worry about

  (** [many] is used to create lists of interactions all at once. Interactions created
      this way will get flattened prior to benchmark runtime, so that there isn't
      performance cost to using the constructor. *)
  val many : 'action t list -> 'action t

      supplied list of actions. *)

(** [create] produces a benchmark which performs [interactions] on [component].
    The computation is shared between runs within the benchmark runner. Since they are
    run a non-deterministic amount of times, benchmarks created this way should either
    have an interaction which is idempotent on the state, or have similar performance
    when the interaction is repeated many times. *)

    [Interaction.many interactions; Interaction.reset_model; Interaction.stabilize]. *)

(** [benchmark] works identically to [Core_bench_js.bench], but ensures that [Observer]s
    involved in benchmarks are cleaned up between consecutive benchmarks. *)

(** [profile] runs a given [t] as an instrumented computation, and provides snapshots of
    how much time is spent within different parts of bonsai code. It also provides
    statistics on incremental overhead.

    Note: because [profile] runs on an instrumented computation, the total running time
    of the test may be higher. Furthermore, because [profile] only runs the computation
    once, timing may vary between runs. It is useful for drilling into slow benchmarks,
    but [benchmark] should be the source of truth for timing interactions. *)
