module type Up = sig
  (** Values of type [Up.t] are passed from child to parent during a transformation.
      For transformations that use the fallback "skipping-over" recursion, the default
      transformer needs to know how to allocate empty [Up.t] values, and combine [Up.t]
      for computations that have more than one child. *)

  val combine : t -> t -> t

  (** [Computation.lazy] is an obstacle to optimization in many cases.  To force
      optimization authors to think about [lazy], we have a special empty value.

      Optimizations get applied to [Computation.lazy] when it is forced, rather
      than immediately. Thus, we use a constant, [empty_for_lazy], as the value
      that is passed back to the parent computation. *)

      computation constructors that they can't do anything for, while still applying their
      transformation to children of that node. *)

  (** [on_computation] is the function that a user of the transform API must call to
      recursively transform a computation.  The main feature of it is the ability for the
      caller to skip applying their transformation to the provided node, while still
      applying it to the children of that node. This behavior is produced by providing
      [`Skipping_over] to the function, while [`Directly_on] will run the users
      transformation on the node. *)
