# Am_running_how_js

Is a small utility library that is helpful for figuring out which `js_of_ocaml` compiled
OCaml program is running in (e.g. is the program running in the browser vs. in a node
executable vs. in a node executable running in a test?)

You can see the full variant of environments and their docs in
`am_running_how_js.mli`
